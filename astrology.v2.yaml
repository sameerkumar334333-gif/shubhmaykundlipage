    Prokerala.com is an astrology service provider with over 10 years of web presence. Our experienced team of astrologers and programmers have succeeded in creating an absolutely reliable astrology platform which is today trusted by millions of dedicated users including professional astrologers and ardent astrology enthusiasts.

    Prokerala Astrology API is in pursuance of our efforts to make astrology services and information accessable for everyone. Our simple API empowers you to get started with your own astrology services. You'll be up and running in a jiffy!

    ### Step 1. Create an App
    Before you can begin accessing the API, you must first register a new app. You can give the app any name of your choice.

    [Create Your App](/account/client/create)
    ### Step 2. Client ID and Secret
    After registering the app, you will receive a client ID and a client secret. The client ID is considered public information, whereas the client secret must be treated like a password, and must be kept confidential.

    If you are developing single page Javascript apps, or native apps (desktop or mobile), such applications are considered non confidential. You should not embed your credentials in such apps, as anyone can extract the credentials from the app and make requests on your behalf. Instead, you should create a web application that will call the API server with your credentials. Your non confidential app should call the web application, instead of calling the API server directly.
    ### Step 3. Access Tokens
    You will need to authenticate every API calls by passing a valid access token. The access token is generated by making a HTTP POST request, with the above created credentials, to the /token end point.

    ```
    POST /token HTTP/1.1
    Host: api.prokerala.com

    grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&client_secret=<CLIENT_SECRET>
    ```
    Use your `<CLIENT_ID>` and `<CLIENT_SECRET>` created in **Step 1** above. If the request is successful, the server will respond with an access_token that is valid for the next 1 hour. It is not necessary to generate a new access token for every API call. Instead, you should re-use the access token until it expires.

    Sample Response:
    ```
    {
        "access_token" : "ya29.1.AADtN_XK16As2ZHlScqOxGtntIlevNcasMSPwGiE3pe5ANZfrmJTcsI3ZtAjv4sDrPDRnQ",
        "token_type" : "Bearer",
        "expires_in" : 3600
    }
    ```
    ### Step 4. Making Authenticated API Calls
    Now that you have an access token, you can authenticate your API calls by passing the value of access_token in the Authorization header of your API requests.

    You can quickly make an API request using cURL as:
    ```
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>" https://api.prokerala.com/v2/astrology/kundli?ayanamsa=1&coordinates=23.1765,75.7885&datetime=2022-03-17T10:50:40%2B00:00
    ```
    That's it! To make the above process easy, we have an [open source PHP SDK](https://github.com/prokerala/astrology-sdk). The source code of our [API demo](/demo) is also open source, and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/prokerala/astrology-api-demo).

      description: 'The <b>Batch Marriage Compatibility API </b> allows you to compare one primary profile against up to 500 profiles in a single request. Credits are calculated in blocks of <b>50 profiles</b>, meaning that matching up to 50 profiles consumes <b>2,000 credits</b>. Even if you match fewer than 50 profiles—such as 40—the cost remains 2,000 credits. If the request includes more than 50 profiles, credits increase in multiples of 50; for example, matching <b> 55 profiles </b> uses <b>4,000 credits</b>, and matching <b>500 profiles </b>requires a total of <b>20,000 credits</b>.'

        The `datetime` and `rasi` parameters are optional, but one of them must be provided. If only `rasi` is given, the `is_peak` value will be set to `null`, as the `datetime` parameter is necessary for calculating the peak nakshatra.

              prediction: 'You''re in the middle of a controversy, but don''t worry--you''re learning from each other. Your position doesn''t need defending; the good parts will be clear to everyone, and the bad parts can be left behind easily. You''re probably feeling pretty frazzled by now, like other people are in charge and they''re not doing as good a job as you would like. But don''t let the person who''s talking the loudest take control.'
